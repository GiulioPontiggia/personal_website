# Description
This is a project of mine aimed to share my journey learning of whatever I'm interested at the moment.
I've just started it (November 2024) so you won't find much now but stay connected and you'll see some updates.

# Technical details
This website is built with simple html, css and js code. I'm not a web developer and everything I know is self-taught.
Any suggestion to make this better is welcome, feel free to contact me anytime.
The hosting is done through an S3 bucket on AWS, I bought the domain with Route53 and content is distributed through cloudfront.
The code is also integrated with this repository on github through codepipeline and it's dynamically updated.
