                <div class="subtitle">Register a domain on Route 53</div>
                <div>To run a working website you need a domain from where clients can reach it typing the fqdn on the research bar of their browser, you can do that buying and registering a domain on Route53.</div>
                <br>
                <div>Open AWS console and enter Route 53 <br>
                    Click on domain registration to register you brand new domain</div>
                <img class="image" src="image0.png" alt="">
                <div class="image_description">1.1 Route 53 dashboard - Domain registration</div>
                <div>
                    In the top right of the screen click on register domains and enter your desired 2LD (in example.com example is the 2LD). <br>
                    <br>
                    Once found your desired domain proceed with the checkout and fill the contacts information. <br>
                    <br>
                    Once done you can go back to the Route 53 dashboard and click on hosted zone <br>
                    Here you need to create the hosted zone for your new domain where we’ll configure all the DNS records needed for your website.

                <div>
                    Input the domain name just created, enter a description if you want and create the hosted zone. <br>
                    After that you should see it in the list of hosted zones in Route 53.

                <div class="subtitle">Request the certificates with Certificate manager</div>
                <div>
                    To avoid the browser alerts saying that the website is not secure you need to request certificates, in that way clients can secure the connection to the server that will host your website. <br>
                    <br>
                    Make sure that at the top right of the screen the selected region is us-east-1. <br> We will create the certificates in this region as CloudFront (another AWS service we’ll user later) manages certificates in this region. <br>
                    If you plan to not use cloudfront you can skip this task.
                </div>
                <img class="image" src="image2.png" alt="">
                <div class="image_description">2.1 Change region to us-east-1</div>
                <div>
                    In Certificate manager’s dashboard request certificate and click next 
                    <br> <br>
                    Enter the domain name you chose before, it’s suggested to enter it with www. and without at the beginning of the fqdn (ex. www.example.com and example.com)
                    <br> <br>
                    You might need to wait some time for the next steps as the certificate will need to be validated.
                    <br> <br>
                    Once you see the certificate status as “issued” you can click on it to enter the configuration and click on “Create records in Route 53” and create the records.
                    <br> <br>
                    Now if you go back to route 53, enter your hosted zones and click on the previously created hosted zone you’ll see 2 new CNAME records</div>

                    This policy make sure that everyone can access the content of this bucket to access your website, this means you don’t want anything private to be on that S3 bucket.
                    <br><br>

                <div>
                    Now you can upload the files for your website in the bucket and you can test them accessing the web page through the URL you see at the bottom of the “Static website hosting” section.
